==========
-Finished instruction decoder for sh-4
-Implemented a few more instructions
-Now it crashes while reading SH-4 mapped registers (EXPEVT one) need to implemented them
-Intial SH4 mapped implementation (for reading EXPEVT value)

24/10/2018
==========
-Added configuration file class
-Started skeleton for interpreter cpu
-Added first cpu instruction (MOV #imm,Rn)
-Added another cpu instruction ( SHLL16 Rn)

22/10/2018
==========
-More instructions to disassembler

12/10/2018
==========
-More instructions to disassembler

11/10/2018
==========
-added read16 to memory in order to start disasm instructions (so far it appears that bios opcode strings are correct)
-better output with String.format
-Added dissasembler decoder and implemented some simple instructions disasm
-More dissasembler work

10/10/2018
==========
-Intial project creation
-Added simple log class
-Added static init class
-Implemented loading of bin file (bios file to be specific ) to a bytebuffer
